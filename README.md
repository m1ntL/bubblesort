# bublesort.cpp

a buble sort implemented with callback function.

for me a junior programmer, there are two problems need attention.

1. the arguements pass to swap() must be memory address to make the operation of swap really happen.
2. the concept of callback function. it's essenc is a pointer pointed to a function.
